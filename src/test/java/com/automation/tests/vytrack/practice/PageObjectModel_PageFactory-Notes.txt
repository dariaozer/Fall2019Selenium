Implicit wait doesn't get along with Explicit wait. If you gonna use them in the same test,
it might cause unexpectedly long delays.
If we would use Implicit wait -- it would go into @BeforeMethod

*Explicit wait - used inside a test itself,since we have to provide WebElement,  unless @BeforeMethods use some kind of WebElements

TestBase-- abstract class that is used as a basements for all test classes.
it provides minimum essential setup and cleanup for every test of our project.
It is abstract because it has to be extended.
TestBase doesn't contain @Test s.
In TestBase, we initialize WebDriverWait, Actions class objects, and open the browser.
TestBase should be stored under tests package or some kind of base package, BUT NOT under utilities package.
Only re-usable codes go under utilities package.
We do not call methods from TestBase, nor we initiate aby object from it>Therefore, it does not go under utilities package.
We can also add @Before/After Test, class, suit methods if needed.

A small reminder : Singleton class---->It private static instance, private constructor, and public setter methods.

POM is test automation design pattern.
when you create a page class are you storing all the WebElement locators as variables,
and then have basic navigation methods built in as well that you can call upon

pages package -- to store
